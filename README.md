# Note Taker 

(https://jesus-note-taker-heroku.herokuapp.com/)
## Description<br>

This app allows the user write and save notes. It was created to help track notes for a user who needs to store them in a database. It allows the user to store an unlimited amount of notes. I learned how to create a database as well as how fetch requests work with express server routes. It also help me learn how to deploy an application to heroku.

When the user goes to the homepage they are met with a screen that says "Note Taker", with a button below that says "Get Started". The user must click the button to proceed to the note taking page.

Once on the note taking page the user will be met with a field that says Note Title and Note Text. The user must write in both fields once text is in both fields a save button will appear. When the save button is clicked it will save the contents of the fields on the left side of the page. The user can then click the plus sign in the top right to get a new note to write in. If the user would like to revist a previous note they can click on a note on the left side and it will be displayed on the page
